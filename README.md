## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught Software Engineer with a passion for hacking software, finding creative solutions, and programming in general. Skilled in Ruby, Common Lisp, and a wide array of other technologiesâ€”I believe the specific tools matter less than the drive to solve problems. Outside of coding, I enjoy nature, music, and leading a moderately active lifestyle.
